You can see a\n     * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n     *\n     * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n     *\n     * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n     * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n     *\n     * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n     * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n     * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n     * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n     *\n     * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n     * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n     * than the domain model's value on submit.\n     *\n     * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n     *\n     * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n     *\n     * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n     *\n     *  @stable\n     */\n    var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n        __extends$7(NgModel, _super);\n        function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n            _super.call(this);\n            /** @internal */\n            this._control = new FormControl();\n            /** @internal */\n            this._registered = false;\n            this.update = new EventEmitter();\n            this._parent = parent;\n            this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n            this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n            this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n        }\n        NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n            this._checkForErrors();\n            if (!this._registered)\n                this._setUpControl();\n            if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n                this._updateDisabled(changes);\n            }\n            if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n                this._updateValue(this.model);\n                this.viewModel = this.model;\n            }\n        };\n        NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n        Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n            get: function () { return this._control; },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n            get: function () {\n                return this._parent ?
